The repository contains some of my paintings.

## 1. The Apricot Sky Above The Mystic Blue Mountains

It feels as though the setting sun bids farewell to the day, retreating beyond the azure hills to rest in the crimson embrace. The formless sky, painted with hues of milk and vermilion, crafts an ethereal canvus. Draped in the veil of twilight, the pine trees, too, lend their charm, exuding a serene splendor.

## 2. Amber Glow of Twilight With Pines Reflects on Calm Waters

A serene sunset graces the horizon, casting a golden glow over calm waters. Tall pine trees rame the scene, their silhouettes blending harmoniously with the tranquil sky. The reflection in the water mirrors nature's quit beauty, evoking a sense of peace and stillness.

## 3. Moonrise Above Scarlet River

A tranquil night scene. The bright full moonlight creates a soothing atmosphere against the deep violet background of the sky. The moon's glow reflects on the calm water, forming a silvery path. The silhouettes of tall trees on both sides add depth and natural beauty to the painting. The contrast between the bright moon and the dark elements enhances the painting's charm and captivating ambiance.
